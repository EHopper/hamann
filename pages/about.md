We celebrate Paul & Hilde Hamann: artists, innovators, refugees. While a few pieces of Paul's work are publicly accessible (e.g. at the [National Portrait Gallery](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07854/paul-hamann)), their  legacy is at risk of disappearing into the void. Here, we preserve their [art](/art) and their [story](/bio).

This website is the work of their granddaughter, Karen Hopper. Her interest in the story of her remarkable grandparents was piqued by the [Insiders Outsiders Festival](https://insidersoutsidersfestival.org/). If you are interested in more information, or want to share stories of your own, please get in touch!
