Paul and Hilde Hamann were talented and innovative artists: he, a sculptor; she, a painter and ceramicist. Much of their early work was lost, as they were repeatedly forced to flee from Nazi persecution. While a few pieces of Paul's work are publicly accessible (e.g. at the [National Portrait Gallery](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07854/paul-hamann)), their  legacy is at risk. Here, we preserve their [art](/art) and their [story](/bio).

This website is the work of their granddaughter, Karen Hopper. Karen had a peripatetic life travelling after a husband in the oil industry, helping their three children cope with being educated in England, Texas, and Western Australia. She finally settled in beautiful North Devon. Her interest in the story of her remarkable grandparents was boosted by the [Insiders Outsiders Festival](https://insidersoutsidersfestival.org/).

Web design & editing by their great-granddaughter, Emily Hopper. Emily is a data scientist and recovering seismologist based in upstate New York.
